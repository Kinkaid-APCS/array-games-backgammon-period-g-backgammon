	// means that there are 3 white pieces trying to move to higher numbered

	// pieces trying to move to lower numbered spaces.

	// the "negative" team is trying to move its pieces to smaller numbers,
	// then moving them to 0 or less actually removes them from the board - they
	// don't go to position 0. On the other hand if a "positive-moving" piece is
	// captured, it goes to position 0, the farthest point from it's goal of 25 or
